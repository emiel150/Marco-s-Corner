Observations concerning the application:

25-06-2015	DIRN	Currently the application makes doesn't discriminate between rendering
					actions and processing actions. Both are requested via URL. As as result
					rendering actions are generally not mapped to processing request and
					therefore produce a line in the error-log.

22-05-2015	DIRN *	When a user fills out and submits a form, the data entered by the user
					is not stored. Currently the original form is presented back to the user.
					
					[SOLVED] See syllabus.						
					
19-05-2015	DIRN	In the rendering scripts PHP logic, templating and interaction with
					the database is intertwined. This is bad from the perspective of
					maintainability. We need to think of ways how to improve this.

18-05-2015	DIRN	The processing scripts show repetition of code. This is bas from the per-
					spective of maintainablity and code-reuse.
