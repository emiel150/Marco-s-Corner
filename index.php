	 * Non OO_PHP-Template application.The file index.php
	 * serves as relay-station. It generates the default
	 * webpage, sets a default header, navigation and footer
	 * and can dynamically generate the `middle' content
	 * based upon a suitable PHP function (the action request) called.
	 * 
	 * index.php decides what function to apply, i.e. what
	 * action to take, based upon the action argument it receives
	 * via the URL. It it important to understand that ALL user-actions
	 * , hence GET- and POST requests this application receive are 
	 * relayed trough this file.
